Inspiration
New users find token swapping and bridging confusing. The process is complex. Bridge exploits have cost billions. Beginners face high fees. Investments spread across chains make this step necessary. Non-Ethereum chains hold nearly 40% of TVL. Growing L2s offer over 1000x Ethereum TPS. These chains enable fast and creative trading strategies.

What It Does
Swaphub is a one-click, non-custodial, multichain swap platform. It acts as a one-stop shop for crypto investors. It allows you to buy, stake and swap. It visualizes relevant network data. It hides the complexities of cross-chain liquidity. It diversifies investment opportunities.

How We Built It
We built the frontend with React and Next.js. We styled it with Tailwind CSS and Chart.js. We connected wallets with ethers.js and RainbowKit. We developed smart contracts in Solidity. Our contracts interact with Uniswap pools for swaps. We automate wallet switching using MetaMaskâ€™s API.

Challenges We Ran Into
We managed complex gas fee calculations. We integrated with Uniswap for competitive pricing. We automated network switching seamlessly. We ensured robust communication between the frontend and smart contracts.

What's Next for Swaphub
We plan to partner with leading DeFi projects. We will add more trading strategies and enhanced analytics. We will implement extra security protocols. We will refine the user experience even further.
